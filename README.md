# SoundStage Pro

SoundStage Pro is a fork of Logan Olson's magnificent [SoundStage VR](https://github.com/googlearchive/soundstagevr). The intention of SoundStage Pro is to enhance the original version so that it is better suited for teaching and performing in the context of experimental electronic music, to make it feel less like a game and more like an actual sound laboratory. To recreate the experience of working in spatial setups, but without being bound to mimicking the physical past. Where are the limits of the digital realm, and where are its sweet spots? 

Binaries will soon be made available on SideQuest, Oculus App Lab and maybe the Oculus Quest Store as well. The project is currently funded by an educational grant of the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW).

Project team:
Hannes Barfuss, Ludwig Zeller

Initial Oculus Quest port by [James Surine](https://github.com/plaidpants/soundstagevr). 

Models: 'Rubber Med Gloves' by Komodoz, 'surgical mask' by F2A, 'Safety Goggles' by bariacg.
