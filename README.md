# SoundStage Lab

SoundStage Lab is a fork of Logan Olson's magnificent [SoundStage VR](https://github.com/googlearchive/soundstagevr). The intention of SoundStage Lab is to enhance the original version so that it is better suited for teaching and performing in the context of experimental electronic sound and music, to make it feel less like a game and more like an actual sound laboratory. We want to recreate the experience of working in spatial setups, but without being bound to mimicking the physical past. Where are the limits of the digital realm, and where are its sweet spots? 

SoundStage Lab is work-in-progress. Please always link to this repository if you fork, deploy or otherwise redistribute it, in order to keep downstream users in sync with our ongoing development.

Binaries will soon be made available on SideQuest, Oculus App Lab and the Oculus Quest Store as well. The project is partially funded by an educational grant of the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW).
