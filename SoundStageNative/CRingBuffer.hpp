///FrameRingBuffer guarantees the following at any time:
///
///1. Write and Read operation complexity is independent from oversampling factor.
///2. The ptr of the ringBuffer is always in frame 0 with offset 0.
///3. The ringbuffer boundary is always a frame boundary; in other words: There is always a frame starting at ringbuffer index 0, and there is always a frame ending at ringuffer index (n-1).
///4. Adjacent frames never have the same oversampling factor. Exception: The last and the first frame in the ringbuffer can have the same oversampling factor (also see see 3).
///5. Frames are non-overlapping
///6. Frames cover the whole ringbuffer
///
///The RingBuffer itself is identical to RingBuffer.cpp. The frames are stored in an additional vector of FrameHeader metastructs. The overhead for storing the frames is very small.
///
///FrameRingBuffer is not thread-safe.
