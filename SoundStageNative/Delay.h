///This is a delay audio effect that emulates a bucket-brigade delay. It operates on a fixed-size buffer.
///The delay time is determined by the oversampling factor used to write/read to the buffer.
///This results in the characteristic "pitch-shift" effect when changing the delay time while there is still signal in the delay buffer.
///
///Note that the delay ignores multi-channel input: The first channel is used as input and copied to all output channels.
///
///All functions are not thread-safe, hence the caller must avoid simultaneous access from multiple threads.
