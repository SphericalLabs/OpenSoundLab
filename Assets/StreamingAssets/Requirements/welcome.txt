Hello and welcome to OpenSoundLab!

Great that you made it here. OSL is the product of many hours research and tinkering and we hope that you enjoy using it just as much as we do.

Before you can use the app you need to acknowledge our usage terms and grant the app some permissions. You can find the source code of the app on GitHub, so feel free to modify OpenSoundLab to your liking!

Yours sincerely,
the OSL team & Ludwig Zeller
