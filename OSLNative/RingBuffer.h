/// A basic ring buffer that can be used for delay lanes etc.

/// All functions are not thread-safe, hence the caller must avoid simultaneous access from multiple threads.
///
/// However, it is easy to use the RingBuffer in a multi-threaded environment with one reader and one writer thread:
/// You just have to ensure that the reader thread and the writer thread operate on non-overlapping parts of the RingBuffer.
